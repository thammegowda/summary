# Research Summaries

This is a repository hosting the site `Research Summaries`.
The website itself is hosted under `docs` directory.
The rest of the repository hosts tools for generating the site.

`Research Summaries` are 'almost' 'like' survey papers, but these have some degree of informal-ness. The summaries are written like a documentary narrated by "me" to "you" personally. "Me" can be anyone interested in telling a story (contributions are welcome), and "you" is some one interested in exploring the research at high level (first pass) before narrowing down to a list of papers that must be read.


# How to contribute
All contributions - big or small - are welcome! Issues and Pull requests are the way to go.
1. If you detect errors: typos, wrong citation, anchors - please let us know
2. If you find some essential work is not included in the summary - please let us know.
